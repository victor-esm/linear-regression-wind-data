# linear-regression-wind-data
Multiple linear regression from INMET met mast data.<br>
Dependent/target variable: wind speed. <br>
Independent variables: wind direction and temperature. <br><br>

Pressure was not considered because it is highly uncorrelated with wind.<br>
Humidity was not considered because it is higly correlated with temperature.<br><br>

As expected, the result is very poor.<br>
Better correlations can be achieved in met masts with control/mid-blade/lower-blade anemometers as independent variables for the target dependent variable top wind speed.
