# linear-regression-wind-data
Multiple linear regression from INMET met mast data.
Dependent/target variable: wind speed,
Independent variables: wind direction and temperature

Pressure was not considered because it is highly uncorrelated with wind
Humidity was not considered because it is higly correlated with temperature

As expected, the result is very poor.
Better correlations can be achieved in met masts with control/mid-blade/lower-blade anemometers as independent variables for the target dependent variable top wind speed.
